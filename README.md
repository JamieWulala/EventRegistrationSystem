# EventRegistrationSystem
This a event registration system that is able to register events and participants via android and web 
This system has two front ends, one Android and one Web, and one backend based on Java spring framework.
It's able to register a participant with name, to register a event with name, date, startTime and endTime, to register a participant
to an event, and list all events and participants.

It's fairly simple system, I worked on the backend and the web front end, and my partner worked on the Android front end.
